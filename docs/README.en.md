## ⚠️ Customization Notes  
- Bundling code is located in `/Trojans`.  
- Current implementation prioritizes minimalism to reduce detection risks.  
- For real-world scenarios (e.g., network defense exercises), apply additional encryption, obfuscation, and anti-reverse engineering measures.  
- Payloads with anti-VM/debugging features enhance authenticity, mimicking benign applications.
